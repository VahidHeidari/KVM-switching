RUBY-XKB for WMII
by J. Bromley

* Description

Ruby-Xkb for WMII is a C++ Ruby extension that allows Ruby code to query and
change the XKB layout state. 

XKeyboard.h    interface for a class that queries and sets XKB state (layouts)
XKeyboard.cpp  implementation for XKB query/set class
X11Exception.h C++ exception class
XKeyboard.i    SWiG interface file for XKeyboard class (for Ruby)
extconf.rb     configuration file for Ruby extension
xkbstate       Ruby script to query/change XKB state (used with Ruby extension)
README	       this file
Makefile_XKeyboard builds a shard library from the C++ class, historical only

The C++ class has no special dependencies on anything outside of X-related
libraries, so it can be easily used with other software.


* Building

To build the Ruby extension, do the following.

 1. Generate wrapper for C++ class: swig -c++ -ruby XKeyboard.i
 2. Generate Makefile for Ruby extension: ruby extconf.rb
 3. Build Ruby extension: make
 4. Install Ruby extension: sudo make install


* Script

xkbstate is a Ruby script that uses the Ruby extension to manipulate/query XKB
layouts from the command line. It needs to be cleaned up a little bit, but it
works. For more information, build and install the ruby extension as above and
then run: xkbstate --help.


* Bugs or Problems

If you find any bugs please let me know at jbromley@gmail.com. Admittedly, I
only really tested with a few different layouts that I used, so if you've got
some odd layout or set of layouts there may be problems. Please let me know.
